# Upload API reference


The Upload API is a **rate-unlimited** RESTful API that enables you to upload your media assets (resources) and provides a wide range of functionality, including basic and advanced [asset management](#asset_management), [metadata management](#metadata_management), and [asset generation](#asset_generation). 
[Cloudinary's backend SDKs](backend_sdks) wrap these REST APIs, handle authentication, and enable you to perform these methods using your preferred programming language or framework. This reference provides both SDK and REST/cURL syntax and examples for each endpoint method.

> * [MediaFlows](https://console.cloudinary.com/mediaflows), Cloudinary’s drag-and-drop workflow builder for image and video, supports all Upload API parameters in a low-code environment. See MediaFlow’s documentation on media upload [here](mediaflows_block_reference#upload_media). 

> * You can open the **Media Library** to confirm that your programmatic upload succeeded and that the asset has the expected transformations, tags, metadata, and other parameters. For more information, see the [Media Library for Developers](media_library_for_developers) page.

> * You can also upload and manage assets directly from your IDE using the [Cloudinary VS Code Extension](cloudinary_vscode_extension). This eliminates context-switching between your code editor and browser, helping you stay focused on development.

## Overview

By default, the API endpoints use the following format:

`https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/:cloud_name/:action`

For example, to upload an image asset to the `demo` product environment:

```
POST https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/demo/image/upload
```

### Authentication methods

The Upload API supports the following authentication methods for server-side (backend) uploads:

* **[Basic Authentication](#basic_authentication)** (recommended): Authenticate using your API Key and API Secret via HTTP Basic Auth.
* **[Signature-based authentication](#signature_based_authentication)**: Authenticate by generating a SHA signature with a timestamp.

For client-side uploads, you can also use **[unsigned uploads](upload_presets)** with upload presets.

> **INFO**: Never expose your API secret in public client-side code.

#### Basic Authentication

Similar to the [Admin API](admin_api), you can authenticate Upload API requests using HTTP Basic Authentication with your **API Key** and **API Secret**. This is the simplest authentication method and doesn't require generating signatures or timestamps.

Your Cloudinary **Cloud name**, **API Key**, and **API Secret** can be found on the [API Keys](https://console.cloudinary.com/app/settings/api-keys) page of the Cloudinary Console Settings.

**To upload with Basic Authentication:**

You can pass your credentials either in the URL or in an Authorization header.

**Option 1: Embedded in the URL**

```
curl https://<API_KEY>:<API_SECRET>@api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/<CLOUD_NAME>/image/upload \
  -X POST \
  -F "file=<FILE>" \
  -F "public_id=<PUBLIC_ID>"
```

**Option 2: In the Authorization header**

```
curl https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/<CLOUD_NAME>/image/upload \
  -X POST \
  -u "<API_KEY>:<API_SECRET>" \
  -F "file=<FILE>" \
  -F "public_id=<PUBLIC_ID>"
```

For example, to upload an image to the `demo` product environment:

```
curl https://112233445566778:AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz12@api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/demo/image/upload \
  -X POST \
  -F "file=sample.jpg" \
  -F "public_id=my_sample"
```

Basic Authentication can be used with any upload parameters, including [upload presets](upload_presets), transformations, tags, metadata, and more.

#### Signature-based authentication

All the methods in this API can also be authenticated using a signature generated from your **API Secret**. The Cloudinary SDKs automatically generate this signature for you. When using the REST API calls directly, you need to generate the signature, either [manually](authentication_signatures#manual_signature_generation), or via the [`api_sign_request` SDK method](authentication_signatures#using_cloudinary_backend_sdks_to_generate_sha_authentication_signatures). For more details, see the [Generating authentication signatures](authentication_signatures) documentation.

You can upload an image on your own Cloudinary product environment by replacing the `CLOUD_NAME`, `FILE`, `TIMESTAMP`, `API_KEY`, and `SIGNATURE` in the cURL command below:

```
curl https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/<CLOUD_NAME>/image/upload -X POST --data 'file=<FILE>&timestamp=<TIMESTAMP>&api_key=<API_KEY>&signature=<SIGNATURE>'
```

### API responses

Responses to API calls include information about the action that was performed as well as data about the relevant assets. 

> **TIP**: For more in-depth documentation and general information on uploading media assets see the [Upload](upload_images) guide. For more information on calling the REST API methods directly, see the documentation on [Uploading with a direct call to the API](client_side_uploading#direct_call_to_the_api).

After you upload files, you can use the [Cloudinary Admin API](admin_api), which has useful methods for managing and organizing your media assets, such as listing all uploaded assets, listing tags, finding all assets that share a given tag, updating transformations, bulk deleting, and more.
> **INFO**: Cloudinary may add more fields to API responses and notifications in the future, so please ensure that your response parsing remains forward compatible and won't break as a result of unknown fields.

### Using Postman for Upload REST API calls
Take advantage of our [Cloudinary Postman Collections](https://www.postman.com/cloudinaryteam/workspace/programmable-media/overview?ctx=documentation) to experiment with our REST APIs and view the responses before adding them to your own code. 

Run in Postman

For details on setting up your own fork of our collections and configuring your Postman environment with your Cloudinary product environment credentials, see [Using Cloudinary Postman collections](using_cloudinary_postman_collections).

### Using SDKs with the Upload API

Our [backend SDK libraries](cloudinary_sdks#backend) provide a wrapper for the Upload API, enabling you to use your native programming language of choice. When using an SDK, request building and authentication are handled automatically, and the JSON response is parsed and returned. 

For example, you can use the following SDK command to create an image asset saved to your Cloudinary product environment from a string passed as a parameter:

```multi
|ruby 
result = Cloudinary::Uploader
.text(text)
  
|php_2
$result = $cloudinary->uploadApi()
->text($text);

|python
result = cloudinary.uploader\
.text(text)

|nodejs
cloudinary.v2.uploader
.text(text)
.then(result=>console.log(result));
  
|java
result = cloudinary.uploader()
.text(String text);

|csharp
result = cloudinary.Text(TextParams params);

|go
resp, err := cld.Upload.Text(ctx, uploader.TextParams{})

|swift
result = cloudinary.createManagementApi()
.text(text)

```

> **TIP**: SDK-specific documentation can be found in the [SDK Guides](cloudinary_sdks).
### Using the CLI to access the Upload API

You can use the Cloudinary CLI (Command Line Interface) to interact with the Upload API.  This can provide an easy way to add automation to your workflows and manage your assets without the need for a formal coding environment or having to access your Cloudinary Console. 

You can find instructions for setting up and using the CLI in the [CLI reference](cloudinary_cli).
### Error handling

The Admin API returns the status of requests using HTTP status codes:

**200**: OK | Success. 
**400**: Bad request. 
**401**: Authorization required. 
**403**: Not allowed. 
**404**: Not found. 
**409**: Already exists. 

The SDKs report errors by raising applicative exceptions.
Additionally, an informative JSON message is returned. For example:

```json
{ "error": { "message": "Resource not found - 5traNge_nam3" } }
```


### EU or AP data centers and endpoints	(premium feature)

> **NOTE**: This is a premium feature that is supported only for our [Enterprise plans](https://cloudinary.com/pricing#pricing-enterprise) and must be arranged when the account is created. [Contact our Enterprise support and sales team](https://cloudinary.com/contact?plan=enterprise) or your CSM for more information.

By default, Cloudinary accounts use US-based data centers. In these cases, the endpoint format is as shown at the beginning of this [Overview](#overview).

If the majority of your users are located in Europe or Asia, Cloudinary can set up your account to use our Europe (EU) or Asia Pacific (AP) data center. In that case, your endpoints will take the form: 

`https://api-eu.cloudinary.com/v1_1/:cloud_name/:action`

OR

`https://api-ap.cloudinary.com/v1_1/:cloud_name/:action`

> **TIP**: When using the Cloudinary SDKs you need to set the `upload_prefix` [configuration parameter](cloudinary_sdks#configuration_parameters).

Uploads an asset to your product environment. 

The Cloudinary SDKs wrap the `upload` endpoint and offer two separate methods: one for signed uploading and one for unsigned uploading.

> **NOTES**:
>
> * Some SDKs have a dedicated method for uploading large files using [chunked upload](upload_images#chunked_asset_upload).

> * The [Node.js SDK](node_image_and_video_upload#node_js_upload_methods) has several different methods for uploading files, including ones that take advantages of Node.js's **stream** functionality.

**Learn more**: [Upload guide](upload_images)

### Signed upload syntax

`POST /:resource_type/upload`

```multi
|ruby 
Cloudinary::Uploader.upload(file, options = {})
  
|php_2
$cloudinary->uploadApi()->upload($file, $options = []);
 
|python
cloudinary.uploader.upload(file, **options)

|nodejs
cloudinary.v2.uploader.upload(file, options).then(callback);
  
|java
cloudinary.uploader().upload(String file, Map options);

|csharp
cloudinary.Upload(UploadParams params);

|go
resp, err := cld.Upload.Upload(ctx, file, uploader.UploadParams{})

|dart
cloudinary.uploader().upload(File(file), params: UploadParams(params));

|android
MediaManager.get().upload(file).dispatch();

|swift
cloudinary.createUploader().signedUpload(url: file, params: params) 

|cli
cld uploader upload $file [$options]
```

### Unsigned upload syntax

`POST /:resource_type/upload`

```multi
|ruby 
Cloudinary::Uploader.unsigned_upload(file, upload_preset, options = {})
  
|php_2
$cloudinary->uploadApi()->unsignedUpload($file, $upload_preset, $options = []);

|python
cloudinary.uploader.unsigned_upload(file, upload_preset, **options)

|nodejs
cloudinary.v2.uploader.unsigned_upload(file, upload_preset, options).then(callback);
  
|java
cloudinary.uploader().unsignedUpload(String file, String uploadPreset, Map options);

|csharp
cloudinary.Upload(UploadParams params); 

|dart
cloudinary.uploader().upload(File(file), params: UploadParams(uploadPreset, params));

|go
resp, err := cld.Upload.UnsignedUpload(ctx, file, upload_preset, uploader.UploadParams{})

|android
MediaManager.get().upload(file).unsigned(upload_preset).dispatch();

|swift
cloudinary.createUploader().signedUpload(url: file, uploadPreset: preset) 

|cli
cld uploader unsigned_upload $file $upload_preset [$options]
```
### SDK wrapper methods
The Cloudinary SDKs provide dedicated methods to support large file uploads, offering tolerance for network issues. These methods upload files in chunks and are required for files larger than 100 MB (you'll get a `413 Request entity too large` error otherwise). This is common for video files.

#### upload_large syntax
The SDKs provide an `upload_large` method that chunks the file upload:

```multi
|ruby
Cloudinary::Uploader.upload_large(file, options = {})

|php_2
// Note: PHP SDK automatically handles chunked uploading in the standard upload method
$cloudinary->uploadApi()->upload(file, options = []);

|python
cloudinary.uploader.upload_large(file, **options)

|nodejs
cloudinary.v2.uploader.upload_large(file, options).then(callback);

|java
cloudinary.uploader().uploadLarge(file, Map options);

|csharp
cloudinary.UploadLarge(VideoUploadParams params);

|go
// Note: Go SDK automatically handles chunked uploading in the standard upload method
resp, err := cld.Upload.Upload(ctx, file, uploader.UploadParams{})

|android
MediaManager.get().upload(file).option("resource_type", "video").dispatch();

|swift
cloudinary.createUploader().signedUploadLarge(url: file, params: params)

|cli
cld uploader upload_large $file [$options]
```

For more details and examples, including customizing the chunk size, see [Chunked asset upload](upload_images#chunked_asset_upload).

#### private_download_url syntax
For accessing private or authenticated assets uploaded with the `type` parameter set to `private` or `authenticated`, use the `private_download_url` SDK method to generate a time-limited, signed URL:

```multi
|ruby
Cloudinary::Utils.private_download_url(public_id, format, options = {})

|php_2
$cloudinary->utils->privateDownloadUrl(public_id, format, options = []);

|python
cloudinary.utils.private_download_url(public_id, format, **options)

|nodejs
cloudinary.v2.utils.private_download_url(public_id, format, options);

|java
cloudinary.utils().privateDownload(public_id, format, options);

|csharp
cloudinary.PrivateDownloadUrl(string publicId, string format);

|go
cld.Upload.PrivateDownloadURL(ctx, uploader.PrivateDownloadURLParams{...})

|cli
cld utils private_download_url $public_id $format [$options]
```

For more details and examples, see [Providing time-limited access to private media assets](control_access_to_media#providing_time_limited_access_to_private_media_assets).

### Required parameters
Parameter | Type | Description
---|---|---
file  |  String | The file to upload. It can be: a local file path (supported in SDKs only)the remote HTTP or HTTPS URL address of an existing filea private storage bucket (S3 or Google Storage) URL of an **allowlisted** bucketthe actual data (byte array buffer). For example, in some SDKs, this could be an IO input stream of the data (e.g., File.open(file, "rb")). the Data URI (Base64 encoded), max ~60 MB (62,910,000 chars)the FTP address of an existing fileFor details and examples, see: [file source options](upload_parameters#required_file_parameter).
upload\_preset |  String | **(Required for unsigned uploading / optional for signed uploading)** Name of an upload preset that you defined for your Cloudinary product environment. An upload preset consists of upload parameters centrally managed using the Admin API or from the [Upload Presets](https://console.cloudinary.com/app/settings/upload/presets) page of the Console Settings. An upload preset may be marked as unsigned, which allows unsigned uploading directly from the browser and, for security reasons restricts what can be passed directly in the upload call to this [limited set of parameters](image_upload_api_reference#unsigned_upload_parameters). When you include the same parameter in both the upload preset and in the upload call, the precedence depends both on the type of preset and the specific parameter.  For details, see [Upload preset precedence](upload_presets#upload_preset_precedence).
signature | String | **(Required for signed REST API calls)** Used to authenticate the request and based on the parameters you use in the request. When using the Cloudinary SDKs for signed requests, the signature is automatically generated and added to the request. If you manually generate your own signed POST request, you need to manually generate the `signature` parameter and add it to the request together with the `api_key` and `timestamp` parameters. For more details, see [manually generating signatures](authentication_signatures).
### Optional parameters
Parameter | Type | Description
---|---|---
`Naming and storage:` | |
public\_id  | String | The identifier that's used for accessing and delivering the uploaded asset. If not specified, then the public ID of the asset will either be comprised of random characters or will use the original file's filename, depending whether `use_filename` is set to true.Notes:The public ID value for images and videos shouldn't include a file extension. Include the file extension for `raw` files only.Can be up to 255 characters, including non-English characters, periods (`.`), forward slashes (`/`), underscores (`_`), hyphens (`-`).Can't begin or end with a space or forward slash (/).Shouldn't include any of these characters: `? & # \ % < > +`.
public\_id\_prefix | String | A string or path that's automatically prepended to the `public_id` with a forward slash. The value can contain the same characters as the `public_id` including additional forward slashes. This prefix can be useful to provide context and improve the SEO of an asset's filename in the delivery URL, but the value doesn't impact the location where the asset is stored.Components in the `public_id_prefix` can't start with 'v' followed by numeric characters, since that format is used for the version segment in delivery URLs. **Not relevant for product environments using the legacy fixed folder mode.**
display\_name | String | A user-friendly name for the asset.**Default:** Same value as the `public_id` (or the last segment of the public ID if the public ID includes slashes). Display names can have spaces and special characters and can have up to 255 characters, but can't include forward slashes (/). This name can be completely different than the asset's `public id` and its value doesn't impact the delivery URL in any way. The display name is shown in user interface pages such as the [Media Library](https://console.cloudinary.com/console/media_library/search), Cloudinary collections, and Cloudinary basic portals.   Though not a best practice, it's possible for the same display name to be used for different assets, even in the same asset folder. **Not relevant for product environments using the legacy fixed folder mode.**
asset\_folder | String |  The full path of the folder where the asset is placed within the Cloudinary repository. This value doesn't impact the asset's public ID path (unless the `use_asset_folder_as_public_id_prefix` option is applied).**Default**: If not specified, the uploaded asset will be located in the root of your product environment asset repository, even if the public ID value includes slashes. **Notes**:Can be up to 255 characters, including non-English characters, periods (`.`), underscores (`_`), hyphens (`-`).Shouldn't include the following characters: `? & # \ % < > +`.Can't end with a space.**Not relevant for product environments using the legacy fixed folder mode.**
use\_asset\_folder\_as\_public\_id\_prefix | Boolean | Whether to add the `asset_folder` value as a prefix to the `public_id` value (prepended with a forward slash). This ensures that the public ID **path** will always match the **initial** asset folder, and can help to retain the behavior that previously existed in fixed folder mode. However, keep in mind that even when this option is used during upload, an asset with a certain public ID path can later be moved to a completely different asset folder hierarchy without impacting the public ID. This option only ensures path matching for the initial upload.Relevant only when `public_id_prefix` (or `folder`) has not been separately specified.**Default**: `false` **Not relevant for product environments using the legacy fixed folder mode.**
folder | String |  **Only relevant for product environments using the legacy fixed folder mode.** Defines both the full path of the folder where the uploaded asset will be placed and also a path value that's prepended to `public_id` value with a forward slash.None of the segments of the `folder` value can start with 'v' followed by numeric characters, because this format is reserved for the version segment of the URL. **Default**: root folder.**Note**: If [Dynamic folders](folder_modes) mode is enabled on your product environment, this parameter is deprecated, and it's recommended to use the `asset_folder` parameter to control where the asset will be placed. If you also want your `public_id` to match the **initial** asset folder path, include the `use_asset_folder_as_public_id_prefix`parameter.
use\_filename  |  Boolean | Whether to use the original file name of the uploaded file as the `public_id`. Relevant only if the `public_id` parameter isn't set. When `false` and the `public_id` parameter is also not defined, the `public ID` will be comprised of random characters. When `true` and the `public_id` parameter is not defined, the uploaded file's original filename becomes the public ID. Random characters are appended to the filename value to ensure public ID uniqueness if `unique_filename` is true. If the filename of the asset you upload contains a character that's not supported for public IDs, preceding/trailing occurrences are trimmed off, while illegal characters anywhere else in the filename are replaced with underscores.**Default**: `false`.
use\_filename\_as\_display\_name | Boolean |  Whether to automatically assign the original filename of the uploaded asset as the asset's **display name**. Relevant only if the `display_name` parameter isn't set.**Note**: If you set `use_filename_as_display_name` to `true` (in the upload call or upload preset) and the original filename of the asset includes forward slashes, the upload will fail with an error that the display name can't include slashes.**Default**: `false`. **Not relevant for product environments using the legacy fixed folder mode.**
unique\_filename | Boolean | When set to true, appends random characters to the end of the filename to guarantee its uniqueness. This parameter is relevant only if `use_filename` is set to `true`. Additionally, when `disallow_public_id` is `true` in the unsigned upload preset used for an upload, `unique_filename` is also automatically set to `true`. **Default**: `true`.
filename\_override | String | Sets the 'original-filename' metadata header stored on the asset (instead of using the actual filename of the uploaded file). Useful together with the `use_filename` parameter and for advanced search by filename, and relevant when delivering assets as attachments (setting the `flag` transformation parameter to `attachment`).
resource\_type  | String | Set the type of file you are uploading or use `auto` to automatically detect the file type. Only relevant as a parameter when using the SDKs (the `resource_type` is included in the endpoint URL when using the REST API). Valid values: `image`, `raw`, `video` and `auto`. **Defaults**: `image` for server-side uploading (with the exception of the Go SDK which defaults to `auto`) and `auto` for client-side uploading.**Note**: Use the `video` resource type for all video assets as well as for audio files, such as `.mp3`. For details, see [Uploading audio files](upload_parameters#uploading_audio_files).
type  |  String | The delivery type. Allows uploading assets as `private` or `authenticated` instead of the default `upload` mode. Only relevant as a parameter when using the SDKs (the delivery `type` value is part of the endpoint URL when using the REST API). Valid values: `upload`, `private` and `authenticated`. **Default**: `upload`.**For accessing private or authenticated assets:** Use the [private_download_url](#private_download_url_syntax) SDK method to generate time-limited, signed URLs.
access\_control | JSON  | Restrict access to the asset by passing an array of access types for the asset. The asset is restricted unless one of the access types is valid. Possible values for each access type:- `token` requires either [Token-based access](control_access_to_media#token_based_access_premium_feature) or [Cookie-based access](control_access_to_media#cookie_based_access_premium_feature) for accessing the asset. For example: `access_type: "token"`- `anonymous` allows public access to the asset during a set time period. The anonymous access type can optionally include `start` and/or `end` dates (in ISO 8601 format) that define when the asset is publicly available. Note that you can only include a single 'anonymous' access type. For example: `access_type: "anonymous", start: "2017-12-15T12:00Z", end: "2018-01-20T12:00Z"` 
access\_mode | String | Allows the asset to behave as if it's of the authenticated 'type' (see above) while still using the default 'upload' type in delivery URLs. The asset can later be made public by changing its `access_mode` via the [Admin API](admin_api#update_access_mode), without having to update any delivery URLs. Valid values: `public`, and `authenticated`. **Default**: `public`. **Note**: The `access_mode` parameter is no longer supported. To restrict access to assets, you can use the `access_control` parameter. For more details, see [Access-controlled media assets](control_access_to_media#access_controlled_media_assets).
discard\_original\_filename |  Boolean | Whether to discard the name of the original uploaded file. Relevant when delivering assets as attachments (setting the `flag` transformation parameter to `attachment`). **Default**: `false`.
overwrite  | Boolean | Whether to overwrite existing assets with the same public ID. When set to false, a response is returned immediately if an asset with the same public ID is found. When overwriting assets, if you include [versions](advanced_url_delivery_options#asset_versions) in your delivery URLs, you will need to update the URLs with the new version number to deliver the new asset. If you don't include versions, you will need to [invalidate](invalidate_cached_media_assets_on_the_cdn) the old assets on the CDN server cache. **Default**: `true` (when using unsigned upload, the default is false and cannot be changed to true). **Important**: Depending on your product environment setup, overwriting an asset may clear the tags, contextual, and structured metadata values for that asset. If you have a [Master admin](dam_admin_users_groups#role_based_permissions) role, you can change this behavior for your product environment in the [Media Library Preferences](dam_admin_media_library_options) pane, so that these field values are retained when new version assets overwrite older ones (unless you specify different values for the `tags`, `context`, or `metadata` parameters as part of your upload).`Resource data:` | |
tags  |  String | A comma-separated list of tag names to assign to the uploaded asset for later group reference. For example: `animal,dog`**SDKs**: Supports arrays. For example: `['animal', 'dog']`
context | String | A pipe-separated list of the key-value pairs of contextual metadata to attach to an uploaded asset. The context values of uploaded files can be retrieved using the Admin API. For example: <code>alt=My image&#124;caption=Profile image**Notes**:The `=` and <code>&#124; characters can be supported as values when escaped with a prepended backslash (`\`). Key values are limited to 1024 characters and an asset can have a maximum of 1000 context key-value pairs.Keys and values can't be empty.Must be valid UTF-8.Control characters aren't allowed, except for newline and space.**SDKs**: Supports maps. For example: `['alt': 'My image', 'caption': 'Profile image']`
metadata | String | A pipe-separated list of custom metadata fields (by `external_id`) and the values to assign to each of them. For example: <code>in_stock_id=50&#124;color_id=[\"green\",\"red\"]. **SDKs**: Supports maps.**Notes**:The `=`, `"` and <code>&#124; characters can be supported as values when escaped with a prepended backslash (`\`).For a multi-select field, you can set a maximum of 3000 different metadata values on an asset.
clear\_invalid | Boolean | (Relevant for cascading metadata, multiple structured metadata fields on one asset, and [conditional metadata rules](conditional_metadata_rules_api).) When an update would leave one or more stored metadata values invalid—for example, a dependent field becomes invalid after you change another field, or an existing value no longer satisfies a rule that disables the field—those conflicting values are cleared instead of returning an error. This helps when a partial metadata update would otherwise fail re-validation on fields you didn't include in the request. **Default**: `false`.
colors  |Boolean | Whether to retrieve predominant colors & color histogram of the uploaded image. **Note**:If all returned colors are opaque, then 6-digit RGB hex values are returned. If one or more colors contain an alpha channel, then 8-digit RGBA hex quadruplet values are returned. **Default**: `false`. Relevant for images only.
faces  | Boolean | Whether to return the coordinates of faces contained in an uploaded image (automatically detected or manually defined). Each face is specified by the X & Y coordinates of the top left corner and the width & height of the face. The coordinates for each face are returned as an array (using the SDKs) or a comma-separated list (for REST API calls), and individual faces are separated with a pipe (<code>&#124;). For example: <code>10,20,150,130&#124;213,345,82,61. **Default**: `false`. Relevant for images only.
quality\_analysis | Boolean | Whether to return a quality analysis value for the image between 0 and 1, where 0 means the image is blurry and out of focus and 1 means the image is sharp and in focus. **Default**: `false`. Relevant for images only.Paid customers can [request to take part](https://support.cloudinary.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) in the [extended quality analysis](image_quality_analysis#extended_quality_analysis) Beta trial. When activated, this parameter returns quality scores for various other factors in addition to `focus`, such as `jpeg_quality`, `noise`, `exposure`, `lighting` and `resolution`, together with an overall weighted `quality_score`. The `quality_score`, `quality_analysis.color_score` and `quality_analysis.pixel_score` fields can be used in the Search API.

`Manipulations:` | |
eager |  String | A list of transformations to create for the uploaded asset, instead of lazily creating them when first accessed by your site's visitors (see the [Transformation URL API Reference](transformation_reference) for more details on possible values). This option accepts either a single transformation or a pipe-separated list of transformations to create for the uploaded asset.**SDKs**: Supports arrays. (In .NET SDK, parameter name is `EagerTransforms`.)
eager\_async | Boolean | Whether to generate the eager transformations asynchronously in the background after the upload request is completed rather than online as part of the upload call. **Default**: `false`.
eager\_notification\_url | String | An HTTP or HTTPS URL to send a notification to (a webhook) when the generation of eager transformations is completed.
transformation | String | An incoming transformation to run on the uploaded asset before saving it in the cloud. This parameter is given as a string of comma-separated single characters (separated with a slash for chained transformations).**SDKs**: Supports a hash of transformation parameters (or an array of hashes for chained transformations). **Note**: When using the SDK for a dynamically typed language such as Ruby, the transformation parameters can be specified directly without using this `transformation` parameter.
format | String | An optional format to convert the uploaded asset to before saving in the cloud. For example: `jpg`. **Note**: When used together with `allowed_formats`, the `format` conversion only applies to files whose format is **not** listed in `allowed_formats`. Files whose format is listed in `allowed_formats` are stored as-is. For example, if `allowed_formats=jpg,png` and `format=jpg`, uploading a PNG keeps it as PNG, while uploading a GIF converts it to JPG.
face\_coordinates  |  String | Relevant for images only. The coordinates of faces contained in an uploaded image to override the automatically detected faces. Each face is specified by the X & Y coordinates of the top left corner and the width & height of the face. The coordinates for each face are given as a comma-separated list, with individual faces separated with a pipe (<code>&#124;)). **For example**: <code>10,20,150,130&#124;213,345,82,61.**SDKs**: Supports arrays. For example: `[[10, 20, 150, 130],[213, 345, 82, 61]]`.**Note**: Not relevant (ignored) in upload presets.
custom\_coordinates | String | Relevant for images only. The coordinates of one or more regions contained in the image being uploaded that can be subsequently used for cropping or adding layers using the `custom` gravity mode. Specify regions by the X & Y coordinates of the top left corner and the width & height of the region, as a comma-separated list. For example: `85,120,220,310`. To specify more than one region, separate them with a  pipe (<code>&#124;), for example: <code>85,120,220,310&#124;150,180,100,300. **SDKs**: Supports arrays. For example: `[85, 120, 220, 310]`.**Note**: Not relevant (ignored) in upload presets.[Learn more](custom_focus_areas#custom_coordinates).
regions | JSON | Relevant for images only. The coordinates of one or more named regions contained in the image being uploaded that can be subsequently used for cropping using the [region](transformation_reference#g_region) gravity mode. Each region is specified by a name (alphanumeric characters and hyphens permitted) and an array of at least two X,Y coordinate pairs, e.g., `{ "name1": [[1, 2], [3, 4]], "name2": [[5,6], [7,8], [9,10]] }`. If two pairs are specified, these refer to the top left and bottom right coordinates of a rectangle. Otherwise, if more pairs are specified, they refer to the corners of a custom region.**Note**: Not relevant (ignored) in upload presets.[Learn more](custom_focus_areas#custom_regions).
background\_removal | String | Automatically remove the background of an image. Set to `cloudinary_ai` to use Cloudinary's built-in deep-learning based functionality. **Note**: It's recommended to store the original and use [background removal on the fly](background_removal). Set to `pixelz` to use the human-powered [Pixelz Remove-The-Background Editing add-on](remove_the_background_image_editing_addon) service. **Note**: This add-on is discontinued and not available for new customers.Relevant for images only.(Asynchronous) 
raw\_convert | String | Generates a related file based on the uploaded file.Set to <code>aspose to automatically create a PDF or other image format from a <code>raw Office document using the Aspose Document Conversion add-on. (Asynchronous)Set to <code>google_speech to instruct the Google AI Video Transcription add-on to generate an automatic transcript <code>raw file from an uploaded video. (Asynchronous)Set to <code>extract_text to extract all the text from a PDF file and store it in a <code>raw JSON file with a public ID in the format: [pdf_public_id].extract_text.json. The full URL of the generated JSON file is included in the API response. Unlike the above <code>raw_convert options, this option doesn't require registering for an add-on. (Synchronous)See also: Converting raw files.
|`Additional options:` | 
allowed\_formats | String | A comma-separated list of file formats that are allowed for uploading. Files of other types will be rejected. The formats can be any combination of image types, video formats or raw file extensions. For example: `mp4,ogv,jpg,png,pdf`. **Default**: any supported format for images and videos, and any kind of raw file (i.e. no restrictions by default). **SDKs**: Supports arrays. For example: `[mp4, ogv, jpg, png, pdf]`**Note**: You can also add the `format` parameter to convert other file types instead of rejecting them. In this case, only files that would normally be rejected are converted, any file format allowed for upload won't be converted.
async | Boolean | Tells Cloudinary whether to perform the upload request in the background (asynchronously). **Default**: `false`.**Python SDK note**: Because `async` is a reserved keyword in Python,pass it using dictionary unpacking with `**`, for example: `cloudinary.uploader.upload("sample.jpg", **{"async": True})`
backup  | Boolean | Tell Cloudinary whether to [back up](backups_and_version_management) the uploaded asset. Overrides the default backup settings of your product environment.
callback | String |  **Deprecated**. A URL to redirect to after the upload is completed instead of returning the upload response. 
eval | String |  Allows you to modify upload parameters by specifying custom logic with JavaScript. This can be useful for conditionally adding tags, contextual metadata, structured metadata or eager transformations depending on specific criteria of the uploaded file. For more details see [Evaluating and modifying upload parameters](upload_parameters_processing#eval_modify_upload_options_before_upload).
on_success | String |  Allows you to update an asset by specifying custom logic with JavaScript that is executed after the upload to Cloudinary is completed successfully. This can be useful for conditionally adding tags, contextual metadata, and structured metadata, depending on the results of using the `detection` parameter on upload. For more details see [On Success update script](upload_parameters_processing#on_success_update_metadata_after_upload).
headers |String |An HTTP header or a list of headers lines for adding as response HTTP headers when delivering the asset to your users. Supported headers: `Link`, `Authorization`, `X-Robots-Tag`. For example: `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`.**Sending request headers when fetching from a protected remote URL**: When the `file` parameter is a remote HTTP(S) URL, you can use the `headers` parameter to include request headers in the fetch Cloudinary performs against the remote source. This is useful when the remote asset requires authentication, for example with an `Authorization` header.Example (Node.js):```cloudinary.v2.uploader.upload(``````'https://example.com/private/image.jpg',``````{ headers: ['Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded "username:password">'] }``````).then(result => console.log(result));```
invalidate  | Boolean | Whether to invalidate CDN cached copies of a previously uploaded asset (and all transformed versions that share the same public ID). **Default**: `false`.  It usually takes between a few seconds and a few minutes for the invalidation to fully propagate through the CDN. There are also a number of other [important considerations](invalidate_cached_media_assets_on_the_cdn) when using the invalidate functionality.
moderation | String | **For all asset types, set to**:`manual` to add the uploaded asset to a list of pending assets that can be moderated using the Admin API or the [Cloudinary Console](https://console.cloudinary.com/console/media_library).`perception_point` to automatically moderate the uploaded asset using the [Perception Point Malware Detection add-on](perception_point_malware_detection_addon). **For images only, set to**: `webpurify` to automatically moderate the uploaded image using the [WebPurify Image Moderation add-on](webpurify_image_moderation_addon).`aws_rek` to automatically moderate the uploaded image using the [Amazon Rekognition AI Moderation add-on](aws_rekognition_ai_moderation_addon).`duplicate:<threshold>` to detect if the same or a similar image already exists using the [Cloudinary Duplicate Image Detection add-on](cloudinary_duplicate_image_detection_addon). Set `threshold` to a float greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.0 to specify how similar an image needs to be in order to be considered a duplicate. Set `threshold` to 0 to add an image to the index of images that are searched when duplicate detection is invoked for another image. **For videos only, set to**: `aws_rek_video` to automatically moderate the uploaded video using the [Amazon Rekognition Video Moderation add-on](aws_rekognition_video_moderation_addon).`google_video_moderation` automatically moderate the uploaded video using the [Google AI Video Moderation add-on](google_ai_video_moderation_addon).**To request [multiple moderations](moderate_assets#multiple_moderations) in a single API call**:Send the desired list of moderations as a pipe-separated string with `manual` moderation, if relevant, being last. For example: <code>aws_rek&#124;duplicate:0&#124;perception_point&#124;manual**Note**: Rejected assets are automatically [invalidated on the CDN](invalidate_cached_media_assets_on_the_cdn) within approximately ten minutes.(Asynchronous) 
notification\_url |  String | An HTTP or HTTPS URL to receive the upload response (a webhook) when the upload or any requested asynchronous action is completed. If not specified, the response is sent to the **Notification URL** (if defined) in the **Webhook Notifications** settings of your Cloudinary Console. 
proxy  | String | Tells Cloudinary to upload assets from remote URLs through the given proxy. Format: `https://hostname:port`.
return\_delete\_token | Boolean | Whether to return a deletion token in the upload response. The token can be used to delete the uploaded asset within 10 minutes using an unauthenticated API request. **Default**: `false`.
timeout | Integer | (SDKs only) Add this parameter to override the maximum amount of time to wait for a response from Cloudinary before the connection is terminated.



#### Unsigned upload parameters

You can define the following parameters directly in an unsigned upload request:

* `upload_preset` 
* `public_id` 
* `public_id_prefix` ([dynamic folder mode](folder_modes) only) 
* `folder` 
* `asset_folder` ([dynamic folder mode](folder_modes) only) 
* `tags` 
* `context` 
* `metadata` 
* `face_coordinates` 
* `custom_coordinates` 
* `regions` 
* `source` 
* `filename_override` 
* `manifest_transformation` 
* `manifest_json` 
* `template` 
* `template_vars`

While you can only pass any of the above parameters directly in unsigned calls,you can include any supported upload parameter in the [upload preset](upload_presets) that you pass with your unsigned upload call.

**Parameters defined in both the request and the upload preset**

When an unsigned upload request includes one of the above supported parameters and the same parameter is also defined in the upload preset, Cloudinary handles precedence as follows:

* **Single-value parameters:**Cloudinary uses the value from the upload preset. The value in the request is used only if the preset doesn't define that parameter.

* **Multi-value parameters** (e.g., tags, context, metadata):Cloudinary merges the values from both the preset and the request.

**This differs from signed uploads, where parameters defined in the request always take precedence over those in the preset.**

> **NOTE**: Cloudinary always treats `overwrite` as `false` in unsigned uploads, even if the request or upload preset sets it to `true`.

#### Unsigned upload multipart form structure

When making unsigned uploads using raw HTTP requests (without an SDK), you must send a `POST` request with `multipart/form-data` encoding. The following fields are required:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `file` | Binary | Yes | The binary file data to upload |
| `upload_preset` | String | Yes | The name of your unsigned upload preset |

Additional fields (optional):

All [parameters listed above](#unsigned_upload_parameters) can be included as form fields, such as `public_id`, `tags`, `context`, `metadata`, etc.

**Example cURL request:**

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/<CLOUD_NAME>/image/upload \
  -F "file=@/path/to/image.jpg" \
  -F "upload_preset=<YOUR_UNSIGNED_PRESET>"
```

**Example with additional parameters:**

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/<CLOUD_NAME>/image/upload \
  -F "file=@/path/to/image.jpg" \
  -F "upload_preset=<YOUR_UNSIGNED_PRESET>" \
  -F "public_id=my_image" \
  -F "tags=sample,test"
```

> **TIP**: If your request fails, check the response `X-Cld-Error` header or the JSON error body for specific error messages. See [Troubleshooting failed upload requests](ts_troubleshooting_failed_upload_requests#extracting_error_messages_from_unsigned_upload_requests) for more details.

> **NOTES**:
>
> * The response for asynchronous uploads (when setting `async = true`) only includes a few details such as the `status` (pending) and a `batch_id` for tracking. Once the upload completes, the `notification_url` set for the asynchronous upload will receive the full response including the details in the example above.

> * If the public ID of the asset you're uploading already exists, the upload response includes whether the asset was `overwritten` or `existing` (depending on whether the `overwrite` parameter was set to true or false).

Updates existing assets already stored in your product environment. 

This can be useful for updating asset attributes, such as adding/modifying tags or structured metadata values, moving assets to new asset folder locations ([dynamic folder mode](folder_modes) only) or generating [eager transformations](eager_and_incoming_transformations#eager_transformations) to warm up the cache for faster delivery of complex transformations.

### Syntax
`POST /:resource_type/explicit`

```multi
|ruby 
Cloudinary::Uploader.explicit(public_id, options = {})
  
|php_2
$cloudinary->uploadApi()->explicit($public_id, $options = []);

|python
cloudinary.uploader.explicit(public_id, **options)

|nodejs
cloudinary.v2.uploader.explicit(public_id, options).then(callback);
  
|java
cloudinary.uploader().explicit(String public_id, Map options);

|csharp
cloudinary.Explicit(ExplicitParams params); // params includes PublicId

|go
resp, err := cld.Upload.Explicit(ctx, uploader.ExplicitParams{PublicID})

|swift
cloudinary.createManagementApi().explicit(publicId, params: params)

|dart
cloudinary.uploader().explicit(ExplicitParams(publicId,
        params: UploadParams(params)));

|cli
cld uploader explicit $public_id [$options]
```

### Required parameters
Parameter | Type| Description
 --- | --- | ---
public_id | String | The identifier of the uploaded asset or the URL of the remote asset. **Note**: The public ID value for images and videos should not include a file extension. Include the file extension for `raw` files only. 
type | String | The delivery type of the asset. For a list of all possible delivery types, see [Delivery types](image_trans_flags_delivery_types#delivery_types).**Note**: When using the SDKs, specify the `type` parameter in the `options` object.
signature | String | **(Required for signed REST API calls)** Used to authenticate the request and based on the parameters you use in the request. When using the Cloudinary SDKs for signed requests, the signature is automatically generated and added to the request. If you manually generate your own signed POST request, you need to manually generate the `signature` parameter and add it to the request together with the `api_key` and `timestamp` parameters. For more details, see [manually generating signatures](authentication_signatures).
### Optional parameters
Parameter | Type| Description
 --- | --- | ---
resource\_type  | String | The type of asset. Only relevant as a parameter when using the SDKs (the `resource_type` is included in the endpoint URL when using the REST API). Valid values: `image`, `raw`, and `video`. **Default**: `image`. **Note**: Use the `video` resource type for all video assets as well as for audio files, such as `.mp3`.
display\_name | String | A user-friendly name for the asset. Display names can have spaces and special characters and can have up to 255 characters, but can't include forward slashes (/). This name can be completely different than the asset's `public id` and its value doesn't impact the delivery URL in any way. The display name is shown in user interface pages such as the [Media Library](https://console.cloudinary.com/console/media_library/search), Cloudinary collections, and Cloudinary basic portals.   Though not a best practice, it's possible for the same display name to be used for different assets, even in the same asset folder. **Not relevant for product environments using the legacy fixed folder mode.**
asset\_folder | String |  The full path of the folder where the asset is placed within the Cloudinary repository.Setting this value in an `explicit` method moves the asset to the specified asset folder, but does not impact the asset's public ID path. **Notes**:Can be up to 255 characters, including non-English characters, periods (`.`), underscores (`_`), hyphens (`-`).Shouldn't include the following characters: `? & # \ % < >`.Can't end with a space.**Not relevant for product environments using the legacy fixed folder mode.**
eager | String | A list of transformations to create for the uploaded asset, instead of lazily creating them when first accessed by your site's visitors (see the [Transformation URL API Reference](transformation_reference) for more details on possible values). This option accepts either a single transformation or a pipe-separated list of transformations to create for the uploaded asset.**SDKs**: Supports arrays. (In .NET SDK, parameter name is `EagerTransforms`.)
async | Boolean | Whether to perform the request in the background (asynchronously). **Default**: `false`.**Python SDK note**: Because `async` is a reserved keyword in Python, pass it using dictionary unpacking with `**`, for example: `cloudinary.uploader.explicit("sample", **{"async": True})`
eager\_async | Boolean | Determines whether to generate the eager transformations asynchronously in the background. **Default**: `false`.
eager\_notification\_url | String | An HTTP or HTTPS URL to notify your application (a webhook) when the generation of eager transformations is completed.
overwrite | Boolean | When applying eager for already existing video transformations, this setting indicates whether to force the existing derived video resources to be regenerated. Default for videos: `false`.  **Note**: When specifying existing eager transformations for images, corresponding derived images are always regenerated. 
tags | String | A comma-separated list of tag names to assign to an asset that replaces any current tags assigned to the asset (if any). For example: `animal,dog`**SDKs**: Supports arrays. For example: `['animal', 'dog']`
invalidate | Boolean | Whether to invalidate the asset (and all its derived assets) on the CDN. **Default**: `false`.  It usually takes between a few seconds and a few minutes for the invalidation to fully propagate through the CDN. There are also a number of other [important considerations](invalidate_cached_media_assets_on_the_cdn) when using the invalidate functionality.
context | String | A pipe-separated list of the key-value pairs of contextual metadata to attach to an uploaded asset. The context values of uploaded files can be retrieved using the Admin API. For example: <code>alt=My image&#124;caption=Profile image**Notes**:The `=` and <code>&#124; characters can be supported as values when escaped with a prepended backslash (`\`). Key values are limited to 1024 characters and an asset can have a maximum of 1000 context key-value pairs.Keys and values can't be empty.Must be valid UTF-8.Control characters aren't allowed, except for newline and space.**SDKs**: Supports maps. For example: `['alt': 'My image', 'caption': 'Profile image']`
metadata | String | A pipe-separated list of custom metadata fields (by `external_id`) and the values to assign to each of them. For example: <code>in_stock_id=50&#124;color_id=[\"green\",\"red\"]. **SDKs**: Supports maps.**Notes**:The `=`, `"` and <code>&#124; characters can be supported as values when escaped with a prepended backslash (`\`).For a multi-select field, you can set a maximum of 3000 different metadata values on an asset.
clear\_invalid | Boolean | (Relevant for cascading metadata, multiple structured metadata fields on one asset, and [conditional metadata rules](conditional_metadata_rules_api).) When an update would leave one or more stored metadata values invalid—for example, a dependent field becomes invalid after you change another field, or an existing value no longer satisfies a rule that disables the field—those conflicting values are cleared instead of returning an error. This helps when a partial metadata update would otherwise fail re-validation on fields you didn't include in the request. **Default**: `false`.
headers | String | An HTTP header or a list of headers lines for returning as response HTTP headers when delivering the uploaded asset to your users. Supported headers: `Link`, `X-Robots-Tag`. For example: `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`.
face\_coordinates  |  String | Relevant for images only. The coordinates of faces contained in an uploaded image to override the automatically detected faces. Each face is specified by the X & Y coordinates of the top left corner and the width & height of the face. The coordinates for each face are given as a comma-separated list, with individual faces separated with a pipe (<code>&#124;). **For example**: <code>10,20,150,130&#124;213,345,82,61.**SDKs**: Supports arrays. For example: `[[10, 20, 150, 130],[213, 345, 82, 61]]`.
custom\_coordinates | String | Relevant for images only. The coordinates of one or more regions contained in an uploaded image that can be  subsequently used for cropping or adding layers using the `custom` gravity mode. Specify regions by the X & Y coordinates of the top left corner and the width & height of the region, as a comma-separated list. For example: `85,120,220,310`. To specify more than one region, separate them with a  pipe (<code>&#124;), for example: <code>85,120,220,310&#124;150,180,100,300. **SDKs**: Supports arrays. For example: `[85, 120, 220, 310]`.[Learn more](custom_focus_areas#custom_coordinates).
regions | JSON | Relevant for images only. The coordinates of one or more named regions contained in an uploaded image that can be subsequently used for cropping using the [region](transformation_reference#g_region) gravity mode. Each region is specified by a name (alphanumeric characters and hyphens permitted) and an array of at least two X,Y coordinate pairs, e.g., `{ "name1": [[1, 2], [3, 4]], "name2": [[5,6], [7,8], [9,10]] }`. If two pairs are specified, these refer to the top left and bottom right coordinates of a rectangle. Otherwise, if more pairs are specified, they refer to the corners of a custom region.[Learn more](custom_focus_areas#custom_regions).
notification\_url |  String | An HTTP or HTTPS URL to send the notification to (a webhook) when the operation or any additional requested asynchronous action is completed. If not specified, the response is sent to the **Notification URL** (if defined) in the **Webhook Notifications** settings of your Cloudinary Console.
image\_metadata | Boolean | Deprecated. Use `media_metadata` instead. **Default**: `false`.
media\_metadata | Boolean | Whether to return IPTC, XMP, and detailed Exif metadata of the uploaded asset in the response. **Default**: `false`. Supported for images, video, and audio. Returned metadata for images includes: `PixelsPerUnitX`, `PixelsPerUnitY`, `PixelUnits`, `Colorspace`, and `DPI`. Returned metadata for audio and video includes: `audio_codec`, `audio_bit_rate`, `audio_frequency`, `channels`, `channel_layout`. Additional metadata for video includes: `pix_format`, `codec`, `level`, `profile`, `video_bit_rate`, `dar`.(In .NET SDK, parameter name is `Metadata`.)
colors  |Boolean | Whether to retrieve predominant colors & color histogram of the uploaded image. If one or more colors contain an alpha channel, then 8-digit RGBA hex quadruplet values are returned. **Default**: `false`. Relevant for images only.
phash  | Boolean | Whether to return the perceptual hash (pHash) on the uploaded image. The pHash acts as a fingerprint that allows checking image similarity. **Default**: `false`. Relevant for images only.
faces  | Boolean | Whether to return the coordinates of faces contained in an uploaded image (automatically detected or manually defined). Each face is specified by the X & Y coordinates of the top left corner and the width & height of the face. The coordinates for each face are returned as an array (using the SDKs) or a comma-separated list (for REST API calls), and individual faces are separated with a pipe (<code>&#124;). For example: <code>10,20,150,130&#124;213,345,82,61. **Default**: `false`. Relevant for images only.
quality\_analysis | Boolean | Whether to return a quality analysis value for the image between 0 and 1, where 0 means the image is blurry and out of focus and 1 means the image is sharp and in focus. **Default**: `false`. Relevant for images only.Paid customers can [request to take part](https://support.cloudinary.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) in the [extended quality analysis](image_quality_analysis#extended_quality_analysis) Beta trial. When activated, this parameter returns quality scores for various other factors in addition to `focus`, such as `jpeg_quality`, `noise`, `exposure`, `blockiness` and `resolution`, together with an overall weighted `quality_score`. **Note**: Unlike when used with the [upload](#upload) method, the returned `quality_score`, `quality_analysis.color_score` and `quality_analysis.pixel_score` fields are not indexed for search.
accessibility\_analysis | Boolean | Currently available only to paid customers [requesting to take part](https://support.cloudinary.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) in the [accessibility analysis](accessibility_analysis) Beta trial. Set to `true` to return accessibility analysis values for the image.**Default**: `false`. Relevant for images only. **Note**: Unlike when used with the [upload](#upload) method, the `accessibility_analysis.colorblind_accessibility_score` field is not indexed for search.
quality\_override | String | Sets a quality value to override the value used when the image is encoded with Cloudinary's automatic content-aware quality algorithm.
cinemagraph\_analysis | Boolean | Whether to return a cinemagraph analysis value for the media asset between 0 and 1, where 0 means the asset is **not** a cinemagraph and 1 means the asset **is** a cinemagraph. **Default**: `false`. Relevant for animated images and video only. A static image will return 0.
moderation | String | **For all asset types, set to**:`manual` to add the asset to a list of pending assets that can be moderated using the Admin API or the [Cloudinary Console](https://console.cloudinary.com/console/media_library).`perception_point` to automatically moderate the uploaded asset using the [Perception Point Malware Detection add-on](perception_point_malware_detection_addon). **For images only, set to**: `webpurify` to automatically moderate the image using the [WebPurify Image Moderation add-on](webpurify_image_moderation_addon).`aws_rek` to automatically moderate the image using the [Amazon Rekognition AI Moderation add-on](aws_rekognition_ai_moderation_addon).`duplicate:<threshold>` to detect if the same or a similar image already exists using the [Cloudinary Duplicate Image Detection add-on](cloudinary_duplicate_image_detection_addon). Set `threshold` to a float greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.0 to specify how similar an image needs to be in order to be considered a duplicate. Set `threshold` to 0 to add an image to the index of images that are searched when duplicate detection is invoked for another image.  **For videos only, set to**: `aws_rek_video` to automatically moderate the uploaded video using the [Amazon Rekognition Video Moderation add-on](aws_rekognition_video_moderation_addon).`google_video_moderation` automatically moderate the uploaded video using the [Google AI Video Moderation add-on](google_ai_video_moderation_addon). **To request [multiple moderations](moderate_assets#multiple_moderations) in a single API call**:Send the desired list of moderations as a pipe-separated string with `manual` moderation, if relevant, being last. For example: <code>aws_rek&#124;duplicate:0&#124;perception_point&#124;manual**Note**: Rejected assets are automatically [invalidated on the CDN](invalidate_cached_media_assets_on_the_cdn) within approximately ten minutes.
responsive\_breakpoints | [JSON] | Requests that Cloudinary automatically find the best breakpoints. The parameter value is an array of breakpoint request settings, where each request setting can include the following parameters:`create_derived`(Boolean - Required) If true, create and keep the derived images of the selected breakpoints during the API call. If false, images generated during the analysis process are thrown away.`format` (String - Optional) Sets the file extension of the derived assets to the format indicated (as opposed to changing the format as part of a transformation - which would be included as part of the transformation component (e.g., f\_jpg)).`transformation` (String - Optional) The base transformation to first apply to the image before finding the best breakpoints. The API accepts a string representation of a chained transformation (same as the regular transformation parameter of the upload API).`max_width` (Integer - Optional) The maximum width needed for this image. If specifying a width bigger than the original image, the width of the original image is used instead. **Default**: `1000`.`min_width` (Integer - Optional) The minimum width needed for this image. **Default**: `50`. `bytes_step` (Integer - Optional) The minimum number of bytes between two consecutive breakpoints (images). **Default**: `20000`.`max_images` (Integer - Optional) The maximum number of breakpoints to find, between 3 and 200. This means that there might be size differences bigger than the given bytes\_step value between consecutive images. **Default**: `20`.The return response will include an array of the selected breakpoints for each breakpoint request, where the following information is given for each breakpoint: `transformation`, `width`, `height`, `bytes`, `url` and `secure_url`. Relevant for images only.
auto_chaptering | Boolean | Whether to trigger automatic generation of video chapters. Chapters will be generated and saved as a .vtt file with `-chapters` appended to the public ID of the video. You can enable chapters as part of the [Cloudinary Video Player](video_player_customization#video_chapters). **Default**: `false`.  Relevant for videos only.If you're using our [Asia Pacific data center](admin_api#alternative_data_centers_and_endpoints_premium_feature), you currently can't request auto chaptering.
auto_transcription | Boolean or Object | Whether to trigger automatic video transcription, or a set of languages to translate the transcript to, alongside the native language. The transcripts get generated and saved as a .transcript file with the same public ID as the video (and with the language code appended for the translated transcripts). You can use your transcript file to show subtitles or captions using the [Cloudinary Video Player](video_player_customization#subtitles_and_captions). When set to an object, you can include `original_language` (String) to specify the language of the video's audio as a hint for more accurate transcription, and/or `translate` (Array) to request translated transcripts. See [Specifying the original language](video_transcription#specifying_the_original_language). **Default**: `false`.  Relevant for videos only.If you're using our [Asia Pacific data center](admin_api#alternative_data_centers_and_endpoints_premium_feature), you currently can't request auto transcription.
auto_video_details | Boolean | Whether to trigger automatic generation of AI-generated video title, description, and tags. The generated content includes `Video Title` and `Video Description` contextual metadata fields that the [Cloudinary Video Player](video_player_customization#video_titles_and_descriptions) version 3.1.0+ can use to display video title and description information, plus automatic tags for asset management. Cloudinary generates title and description only if no existing `Video Title` or `Video Description` context metadata values exist. Cloudinary adds any generated tags to existing tags on the asset. **Default**: `false`.  Relevant for videos only.Not currently supported by SDKs.If you're using our [Asia Pacific data center](admin_api#alternative_data_centers_and_endpoints_premium_feature), you currently can't request auto video details.

### Example
To perform two eager transformations for the already uploaded image with a public ID of `sample` as follows:
   
1. Crop to a width and height of 400 pixels including the biggest face detected. 
2. Pad to a width of 660 pixels and a height of 400 pixels with a blue background. 

```multi
|ruby  
result = Cloudinary::Uploader
.explicit("sample", 
  type: "upload",
  eager: [
    { width: 400, height: 400, 
	  crop: "crop", gravity: "face"},

### Remote image (fetch) example
Get dimensions/metadata for a remote image (fetch):

To retrieve dimensions and other metadata for a remote image that isn’t yet stored, call the `explicit` method with `type=fetch`, passing the remote URL as the `public_id` (URL-escaped), and set `media_metadata=true`. The asset will be stored as a fetch-type resource and the response will include the requested metadata. You can then query the asset (`type=fetch`) via the Admin API if you need additional details.

```multi 
|ruby 
Cloudinary::Uploader.explicit("https://example.com/images/hero.jpg",
  type: "fetch",
  media_metadata: true)
  
|php_2
$cloudinary->uploadApi()->explicit("https://example.com/images/hero.jpg", [
    "type" => "fetch",
    "media_metadata" => true]);

|python
cloudinary.uploader.explicit("https://example.com/images/hero.jpg",
  type = "fetch",
  media_metadata = True)

|nodejs
const res = await cloudinary.uploader.explicit(
  'https://example.com/images/hero.jpg',
  { type: 'fetch', media_metadata: true }
);

|java
cloudinary.uploader().explicit("https://example.com/images/hero.jpg",
  ObjectUtils.asMap(
    "type", "fetch",
    "media_metadata", true));

|csharp
var explicitParams = new ImageExplicitParams("https://example.com/images/hero.jpg"){
  Type = "fetch",
  Metadata = true};
var explicitResult = cloudinary.Explicit(explicitParams);

|go
resp, err := cld.Upload.Explicit(ctx, uploader.UploadParams{
  PublicID:      "https://example.com/images/hero.jpg",
  Type:          "fetch",
  ImageMetadata: api.Bool(true)})

|dart
cloudinary.uploader().explicit(ExplicitParams("https://example.com/images/hero.jpg",
    params: UploadParams(
        type: "fetch",
        mediaMetadata: true)));

|android
MediaManager.get().explicit("https://example.com/images/hero.jpg")
  .option("type", "fetch")
  .option("media_metadata", true).dispatch();

|swift
let params = CLDExplicitRequestParams()
  .setType("fetch")
  .setMediaMetadata(true)
var mySig = MyFunction(params)  // your own function that returns a signature generated on your backend
params.setSignature(CLDSignature(signature: mySig.signature, timestamp: mySig.timestamp))
let request = cloudinary.createManagementApi().explicit("https://example.com/images/hero.jpg", params: params)

|cli

## rename (public ID)

Run in Postman
Learn more about running Postman collections

Modifies the public ID (or optionally the delivery type) of an existing asset.

After running the `rename` method on an asset, the asset's existing URL and its associated derived assets are no longer valid, although delivery URLs already requested by visitors of your web site or application might still be accessible for a certain period of time through cached copies on the CDN. 

To bypass the CDN caching, you can include the `invalidate` parameter in your POST request in order to also invalidate the cached copies of the asset on the CDN. It usually takes between a few seconds and a few minutes for the invalidation to fully propagate through the CDN. For details on invalidating assets, see [Invalidating cached media assets on the CDN](invalidate_cached_media_assets_on_the_cdn). 

> **TIP**: [MediaFlows](https://console.cloudinary.com/mediaflows), Cloudinary’s drag-and-drop workflow builder for image and video, enables users to easily rename media at scale in a low-code implementation. See MediaFlow’s documentation on renaming media [here](mediaflows_block_reference#rename_media).

### Syntax
`POST /:resource_type/rename`

```multi
|ruby 
Cloudinary::Uploader.rename(from_public_id, to_public_id, options = {})
  
|php_2
$cloudinary->uploadApi()->rename($from_public_id, $to_public_id, $options = []);

|python
cloudinary.uploader.rename(from_public_id, to_public_id, **options)

|nodejs
cloudinary.v2.uploader.rename(from_public_id, to_public_id, options).then(callback);
  
|java
cloudinary.uploader().rename(String from_public_id, String to_public_id, Map options);

|csharp
cloudinary.Rename(renameParams); 

|go
resp, err := cld.Upload.Rename(ctx, uploader.RenameParams{FromPublicID, ToPublicID})

|android
MediaManager.get().rename(from_public_id, to: to_public_id);

|dart
var renameResponse = await cloudinary.uploader().rename(
    params: RenameParams(fromPublicId, toPublicId));

|swift
cloudinary.createManagementApi().rename(from_public_id, to: to_public_id, params: params)

|cli
cld uploader rename $from_public_id $to_public_id [$options]
```

> **TIP**:
>
> The `rename` method is relevant only for modifying the asset's public ID (including any segment of the public ID path). If you want to modify the asset's **display name** and/or **asset folder**, pass a new value for the `display_name` or `asset_folder` parameter in an [Explicit](#explicit) or [Update](admin_api#update_details_of_an_existing_resource) method call.

### Required parameters
Parameter | Type| Description
 --- | --- | ---
from\_public\_id | String | The current identifier of the uploaded asset.
to\_public\_id | String | The new identifier to assign to the uploaded asset.
signature | String | **(Required for signed REST API calls)** Used to authenticate the request and based on the parameters you use in the request. When using the Cloudinary SDKs for signed requests, the signature is automatically generated and added to the request. If you manually generate your own signed POST request, you need to manually generate the `signature` parameter and add it to the request together with the `api_key` and `timestamp` parameters. For more details, see [manually generating signatures](authentication_signatures).
### Optional parameters
Parameter | Type| Description
 --- | --- | ---
resource\_type  | String | The type of asset to rename. Only relevant as a parameter when using the SDKs (the `resource_type` is included in the endpoint URL when using the REST API). Valid values: `image`, `raw`, `video`. **Default**: `image`. **Note**: Use the `video` resource type for all video assets as well as for audio files, such as `.mp3`.
type  |  String | The delivery type of the asset. Only relevant as a parameter when using the SDKs (the delivery `type` is included in the endpoint URL when using the REST API). Valid values: `upload`, `private`, `authenticated`. **Default**: `upload`.
to\_type | String | The new delivery type for the asset. Valid values: `upload`, `private`, `authenticated`. **Default**: the asset's current type is unchanged.
overwrite | Boolean | Whether to overwrite an existing asset with the target public ID. **Default**: `false`.**Important**: Depending on your product environment setup, overwriting an asset may clear the tags, contextual, and structured metadata values for that asset. If you have a [Master admin](dam_admin_users_groups#role_based_permissions) role, you can change this behavior for your product environment in the [Media Library Preferences](dam_admin_media_library_options) pane, so that these field values are retained when new version assets overwrite older ones (unless you specify different values for the `tags`, `context`, or `metadata` parameters as part of your upload).notification\_url | String | An HTTP or HTTPS URL to notify your application (a webhook) when the process has completed. If not specified, the response is sent to the **Notification URL** (if defined) in the **Webhook Notifications** settings of your Cloudinary Console.  
invalidate | Boolean | Whether to invalidate CDN cached copies of the asset (and all its transformed versions). **Default**: `false`.  It usually takes between a few seconds and a few minutes for the invalidation to fully propagate through the CDN. There are also a number of other [important considerations](invalidate_cached_media_assets_on_the_cdn) when using the invalidate functionality.
context | Boolean | Whether to include contextual metadata for the asset in the response. **Default**: `false`.
metadata | Boolean | Whether to include structured metadata for the asset in the response. **Default**: `false`.

## context

Run in Postman
Learn more about running Postman collections

Enables you to manage the contextual metadata stored with an asset.

You can perform different operations with the `context` endpoint by setting the value of the `command` parameter to `add`, or `remove_all`. **SDKs:** The Cloudinary SDKs wrap the `context` endpoint and offer separate methods for these operations.

### Syntax - Add contextual metadata

`POST /:resource_type/context`

```multi
|ruby 
Cloudinary::Uploader.add_context(context, public_ids, options = {})
  
|php_2
$cloudinary->uploadApi()->addContext($context, $public_ids, $options = []);

|python
cloudinary.uploader.add_context(context, public_ids, **options)

|nodejs
cloudinary.v2.uploader.add_context(context, public_ids, options).then(callback);
  
|java
cloudinary.uploader().addContext(StringDictionary context, String[] public_ids, Map options);

|csharp
cloudinary.Context(contextParams); 

|go
resp, err := cld.Upload.AddContext(ctx, uploader.AddContextParams{Context, PublicIDs})

|cli
cld uploader add_context $context $public_ids [$options]
```

### Syntax - Remove all contextual metadata

`POST /:resource_type/context`

```multi
|ruby 
Cloudinary::Uploader.remove_all_context(public_ids, options = {})
  
|php_2
$cloudinary->uploadApi()->removeAllContext($public_ids, $options = []);

|python
cloudinary.uploader.remove_all_context(public_ids, **options)

|nodejs
cloudinary.v2.uploader.remove_all_context(public_ids, options).then(callback);
  
|java
cloudinary.uploader().removeAllContext(String[] public_ids, Map options);

|csharp
cloudinary.Context(contextParams); 

|go
resp, err := cld.Upload.RemoveAllContext(ctx, uploader.RemoveAllContextParams{PublicIDs})

|cli
cld uploader remove_all_context $public_ids [$options]
```

### Required parameters
Parameter | Type| Description
 --- | --- | ---
context | String | (Only relevant when adding contextual metadata) A pipe-separated list of the key-value pairs of contextual metadata to attach to an uploaded asset. The contextual metadata values of uploaded files can be retrieved using the Admin API. For example: <code>alt=My image&#124;caption=Profile image**Notes**:The `=` and <code>&#124; characters can be supported as values when escaped with a prepended backslash (`\`). Key values are limited to 1024 characters and an asset can have a maximum of 1000 contextual metadata key-value pairs.Keys and values can't be empty.Must be valid UTF-8.Control characters aren't allowed, except for newline and space.**SDKs**: Supports maps. For example: `['alt': 'My image', 'caption': 'Profile image']`
public\_ids | String[] | An array of public IDs of assets uploaded to Cloudinary.
command | String | (Only relevant when using the REST API - not for use with SDKs) The action to perform on assets: either `add` the specified contextual metadata, or `remove_all` the contextual metadata key-value pairs assigned.
signature | String | **(Required for signed REST API calls)** Used to authenticate the request and based on the parameters you use in the request. When using the Cloudinary SDKs for signed requests, the signature is automatically generated and added to the request. If you manually generate your own signed POST request, you need to manually generate the `signature` parameter and add it to the request together with the `api_key` and `timestamp` parameters. For more details, see [manually generating signatures](authentication_signatures).
### Optional parameters
Parameter | Type | Description
 --- | --- | ---
resource\_type  | String | The type of asset. Only relevant as a parameter when using the SDKs (the `resource_type` is included in the endpoint URL when using the REST API). Valid values: `image`, `raw`, and `video`. **Default**: `image`. **Note**: Use the `video` resource type for all video assets as well as for audio files, such as `.mp3`.
type  |  String | The delivery type of the asset. Only relevant as a parameter when using the SDKs (the delivery `type` is included in the endpoint URL when using the REST API). **Default**: `upload`. For a list of possible delivery types, see [Delivery types](image_trans_flags_delivery_types#delivery_types).

### Examples
To add the contextual metadata key-pairs `alt=Animal` and `class=Mammalia` to the images with the public IDs of `dog` and `lion`

```multi
|ruby
result = Cloudinary::Uploader
.add_context('alt=Animal|class=Mammalia', ['dog', 'lion'])

|php_2
$result = $cloudinary->uploadApi()
->addContext('alt=Animal|class=Mammalia', ['dog', 'lion']);

## metadata

Run in Postman
Learn more about running Postman collections

Adds values to an asset's metadata fields. 

**Learn more**: [Structured metadata](structured_metadata)

### Syntax
`POST /:resource_type/metadata`

```multi
|ruby 
Cloudinary::Uploader.update_metadata(metadata, public_ids, options = {})

|php_2
$cloudinary->uploadApi()->update_metadata($metadata, $public_ids, $options = array());
  
|python
cloudinary.uploader.update_metadata(metadata, public_ids, **options)

|nodejs
cloudinary.v2.uploader.update_metadata(metadata, public_ids, options).then(callback);
  
|java
cloudinary.uploader().updateMetadata(Map metadata, String[] public_ids, Map options);

|csharp
cloudinary.UpdateMetadata(metadataParams); 

|go
resp, err := cld.Upload.UpdateMetadata(ctx, uploader.UpdateMetadataParams{PublicIDs, Metadata})

|cli
cld uploader update_metadata $metadata $public_ids [$options]
```

### Required parameters
Parameter | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
metadata | String | A pipe-separated list of custom metadata fields (by `external_id`) and the values to assign to each of them. For example: <code>in_stock_id=50&#124;color_id=[\"green\",\"red\"]. **SDKs**: Supports maps.**Notes**:The `=`, `"` and <code>&#124; characters can be supported as values when escaped with a prepended backslash (`\`).For a multi-select field, you can set a maximum of 3000 different metadata values on an asset.
public\_ids | String[] | An array of public IDs of assets uploaded to Cloudinary.
signature | String | **(Required for signed REST API calls)** Used to authenticate the request and based on the parameters you use in the request. When using the Cloudinary SDKs for signed requests, the signature is automatically generated and added to the request. If you manually generate your own signed POST request, you need to manually generate the `signature` parameter and add it to the request together with the `api_key` and `timestamp` parameters. For more details, see [manually generating signatures](authentication_signatures).
### Optional parameters
Parameter | Type | Description
--- | --- | --- 
resource\_type | String | The type of asset. Only relevant as a parameter when using the SDKs (the `resource_type` is included in the endpoint URL when using the REST API). Valid values: `image`, `raw`, and `video`. **Default**: `image`. **Note**: Use the `video` resource type for all video assets as well as for audio files, such as `.mp3`.
type  |  String | The delivery type. Valid values: `upload`, `private` and `authenticated`. **Default**: `upload`
clear\_invalid | Boolean | (Relevant for cascading metadata, multiple structured metadata fields on one asset, and [conditional metadata rules](conditional_metadata_rules_api).) When an update would leave one or more stored metadata values invalid—for example, a dependent field becomes invalid after you change another field, or an existing value no longer satisfies a rule that disables the field—those conflicting values are cleared instead of returning an error. This helps when a partial metadata update would otherwise fail re-validation on fields you didn't include in the request. **Default**: `false`.

### Example
To add the datasource IDs of "id\_us", "id\_uk", and "id\_france" to the metadata field with id 'countryFieldId', to the images with the public IDs of 'shirt' and 'pants':

```multi
|ruby
result = Cloudinary::Uploader
.update_metadata('countryFieldId=[\"id_us\",\"id_uk\",\"id_france\"]', ['shirt', 'pants'])

|php_2
$result = $cloudinary->uploadApi()
->update_metadata('countryFieldId=[\"id_us\",\"id_uk\",\"id_france\"]', ['shirt', 'pants']);

|python
result = cloudinary.uploader\
.update_metadata('countryFieldId=[\"id_us\",\"id_uk\",\"id_france\"]', ["shirt", "pants"])

|nodejs
cloudinary.v2.uploader
.update_metadata('countryFieldId=[\"id_us\",\"id_uk\",\"id_france\"]', [ 'shirt', 'pants' ])
.then(result=>console.log(result));

|java
result = cloudinary.uploader()
.updateMetadata(
  ObjectUtils.asMap(
    countryFieldId, 
    new String[]{"id_us", "id_uk", "id_france"}),
  new String[]{"pants", "shirt"}, 
  null);

|csharp
var metadataParams = new MetadataParams(){
  PublicIds = new List<string>(){'shirt','pants'},
  Metadata = 'countryFieldId=[\"id_us\",\"id_uk\",\"id_france\"]'};
var metadataResult = cloudinary.UpdateMetadata(metadataParams); 

|go
resp, err := cld.Upload.UpdateMetadata(ctx, uploader.UpdateMetadataParams{
    PublicIDs: []string{"sample"}, 
    Metadata: map[string][]string{"countryFieldId": []string{"id_us", "id_uk", "id_france"}}})

|curl
curl https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/demo/image/metadata -X POST --data 'metadata=countryFieldId%3D[\"id_us\",\"id_uk\",\"id_france\"]&public_ids[]=pants&public_ids[]=shirt&timestamp=173719931&api_key=436264276&signature=a788d62f86a2f862af'

|cli
cld uploader update_metadata 'countryFieldId=[\"id_us\",\"id_uk\",\"id_france\"]' shirt pants

> ### Required parameters
> Parameter | Type| Description
>  --- | --- | ---
> public\_id | String | The identifier of the uploaded multi-page file (PDF or animated GIF). **Note**: The public ID for images does not include a file extension.
> transformation | String | A transformation to run on all the pages before storing them as derived images. This parameter is given as a comma-separated list of transformations, and separated with a slash for chained transformations. At minimum, you must pass the `page` transformation with the value `all`. If you supply additional transformations, you must deliver the image using the same relative order of the `page` and the other transformations. If you use a different order when you deliver, then it is considered a different transformation, and will be generated on the fly as a new derived image.**SDKs**: Supports a hash of transformation parameters (or an array of hashes for chained transformations). **Notes**: When using the SDKs, specify the `transformation` parameter  in the `options` object.When using the SDK for a dynamically typed language, the transformation parameters can be specified directly without using this `transformation` parameter, as seen in the examples for Ruby, PHP, Python, and Node.js below.
> signature | String | **(Required for signed REST API calls)** Used to authenticate the request and based on the parameters you use in the request. When using the Cloudinary SDKs for signed requests, the signature is automatically generated and added to the request. If you manually generate your own signed POST request, you need to manually generate the `signature` parameter and add it to the request together with the `api_key` and `timestamp` parameters. For more details, see [manually generating signatures](authentication_signatures).
> ### Optional parameters
> Parameter | Type| Description
>  --- | --- | ---
> type | String | The specific file type of the asset. Valid values: `upload`, `private` and `authenticated`. **Default**: `upload`.
> format | String | An optional format to convert the images before storing them in your Cloudinary product environment. **Default**: `png`.
> notification_url | String | An HTTP or HTTPS URL to [notify](notifications) your application (a webhook) when the process has completed. Cloudinary sends a **single** notification for the entire batch operation, rather than separate notifications for each derived asset.
> ### Example
> To explode a PDF file with the public ID of "sample":

> ## generate_archive
> Run in Postman
> Learn more about running Postman collections
> Creates an archive file that contains all the assets meeting specified tag, public ID, or prefix criteria (or a combination thereof). 
> The archive can contain up to 1000 different assets, and up to 5000 files if adding different derived versions of those assets using transformations. The maximum archive file size is the larger of 100 MB or your product environment's `raw` file size limit. 
> {reading:no-icon title=Important note for free accounts}
> By default, while you can still use this method to generate archive files, Free accounts are blocked from delivering **zip**, **rar**, **tagz**, and other archive formats for security reasons. For details, see [Media delivery](image_delivery_options#blocked_delivery_formats_for_security).
> {/reading}
> {note:title=Archive generation errors}
> If the archive generation requires creating derived assets and the size of the original resource is too big, the operation fails. Depending on your account setup:

> * When performing a `create` action, the operation fails and returns a `400` error.

> * When performing a `download` action, the file downloads, but the archive includes an `ERROR.txt` file explaining the issue.
> To avoid these issues, generate the derived assets using [eager](eager_and_incoming_transformations#eager_transformations) transformations with the [upload](#upload) or [explicit](#explicit) endpoints before attempting to generate the archive.

### Archive content structure
When you generate an archive, the structure and contents depend on whether you apply transformations and how you configure certain parameters:

* **If you apply only one transformation (or no transformations)**, the asset files are stored with their display names only.
* **If you apply more than one transformation using a pipe-separated list**:
  * A derived asset is created for each asset in the archive and for each specified transformation.
  * Depending on the settings of the `skip_transformation_name` parameter, the transformation or a numeric value is appended to the file name to differentiate the assets derived from the same original using different transformations.
  * Depending on the settings of the `flatten_transformations` parameter, asset files derived from the same original may be stored in separate folders named after the original asset's display name.
  > **NOTE**: If your product environment uses the legacy [fixed folder](folder_modes) mode, the assets are stored in the archive with their public IDs instead of display names.

### API parameter vs SDK methods
**API calls:** You can perform different operations with the `generate_archive` endpoint by setting the value of the `mode` parameter to `download`, `create`, or `create_and_download`.

**SDKs:** Instead of relying on the `mode` parameter, the Cloudinary SDKs wrap the `generate_archive` endpoint, offering separate methods for the supported operations.


Refer to the [SDK wrapper methods](#sdk_wrapper_methods) section below for detailed documentation of each method, including parameter support and special considerations.

### SDK wrapper methods
The Cloudinary SDKs provide dedicated methods for the supported archive operations. Instead of using the `mode` parameter in REST API calls, use the appropriate SDK method. Each method maps to a specific REST API mode and supports a defined set of parameters.

#### create_zip
Creates and stores a ZIP archive in your product environment.

**REST API equivalent:** `mode: create`

**Supported SDKs:**

```multi
|ruby 
Cloudinary::Uploader.create_zip(options = {})
  
|php_2
$cloudinary->uploadApi()->createZip($options = []);

|python
cloudinary.uploader.create_zip(**options)

|nodejs
cloudinary.v2.uploader.create_zip(options).then(callback);
  
|java
cloudinary.uploader().createZip(Map options);

|csharp
cloudinary.CreateZip(ArchiveParams params);

|go
resp, err := cld.Upload.CreateZip(ctx, uploader.CreateArchiveParams{})

|cli
cld uploader create_zip $options
```

For detailed parameter documentation, see [Required parameters](#generate_archive_required_parameters) and [Optional parameters](#generate_archive_optional_parameters) below. Parameters applicable to `create_zip` are noted in the parameter descriptions.

#### create_archive
Creates and stores an archive file (ZIP, TAR, or other formats) in your product environment.

**REST API equivalent:** `mode: create`

**Supported SDKs:**

```multi
|ruby 
Cloudinary::Uploader.create_archive(options = {}, target_format = nil)
  
|php_2
$cloudinary->uploadApi()->createArchive($options = [], $target_format = NULL);
 
|python
cloudinary.uploader.create_archive(**options)

|nodejs
cloudinary.v2.uploader.create_archive(options, target_format = null).then(callback);
  
|java
cloudinary.uploader().createArchive(Map options);
-Or-
createArchive(Map options, String targetFormat);

|csharp
cloudinary.CreateArchive(ArchiveParams params);

|go
resp, err := cld.Upload.CreateArchive(ctx, uploader.CreateArchiveParams{})

|cli
cld uploader create_archive $options
```

#### download_zip_url
Generates a time-limited, signed URL that dynamically creates and downloads a ZIP archive. The archive isn't stored in your product environment.

**REST API equivalent:** `mode: download`

**Method name variants:** `downloadZip` (Java), `DownloadArchiveUrl` (.NET)

**Supported SDKs:**

```multi
|ruby 
Cloudinary::Utils.download_zip_url(options = {})
  
|php_2
$cloudinary->uploadApi()->downloadZipUrl($options = []);

|python
cloudinary.utils.download_zip_url(**options)

|nodejs
cloudinary.v2.utils.download_zip_url(options);
  
|java
cloudinary.downloadZip(Map options);

|csharp
cloudinary.DownloadArchiveUrl(ArchiveParams params);

|go
resp, err := cld.Upload.DownloadZipURL(uploader.CreateArchiveParams{})

|cli
cld utils download_zip_url $options
```

#### download_archive_url
Generates a time-limited, signed URL that dynamically creates and downloads an archive file in your specified format (ZIP, TAR, etc.). The archive isn't stored in your product environment.

**REST API equivalent:** `mode: download`

**Method name variants:** `downloadArchive` (Java)

**Supported SDKs:**

```multi
|ruby 
Cloudinary::Utils.download_archive_url(options = {})
  
|php_2
$cloudinary->uploadApi()->downloadArchiveUrl($options = []);
   
|python
cloudinary.utils.download_archive_url(**options)

|nodejs
cloudinary.v2.utils.download_archive_url(options);
  
|java
cloudinary.downloadArchive(Map options);

|csharp
cloudinary.DownloadArchiveUrl(ArchiveParams params);

|go
resp, err := cld.Upload.DownloadArchiveURL(uploader.CreateArchiveParams{})

|cli
cld utils download_archive_url $options
```

#### download_folder
Generates a time-limited, signed URL that dynamically creates and downloads an archive of a complete folder and its subfolders. The archive isn't stored in your product environment.

**REST API equivalent:** `mode: download` with `prefixes` parameter

**SDK-specific:** Specify the folder path (e.g., `samples/animals`) as the first argument. The SDK automatically converts this to the REST API `prefixes` parameter. The folder path is the part of the public ID before the filename, shown as slashes in the delivery URL.

**Supported SDKs:**

```multi
|ruby 
Cloudinary::Utils.download_folder(folder_path, options = {})
  
|php_2
$cloudinary->uploadApi()->downloadFolder($folderPath, $options = []);

|python
cloudinary.utils.download_folder(folder_path, **options)

|nodejs
cloudinary.v2.utils.download_folder(folder_path, options);
  
|java
cloudinary.downloadFolder(String folder_path, Map options);

|csharp
cloudinary.DownloadFolder(string folderPath, ArchiveParams parameters);

|go
resp, err := cld.Upload.DownloadFolder(ctx, folder_path uploader.CreateArchiveParams{})

|cli
cld utils download_folder $folder_path $options
```

### Required parameters
Specify at least one parameter to tell Cloudinary which assets to include in the archive file. You can also specify a combination of these parameters to include a unique union of all matching assets.

**Note for SDK users:** When using SDK methods, pass parameters in the `options` object. The `download_folder` SDK method uses `folder_path` as the first argument instead of the REST API `prefixes` parameter.

Parameter | Type| Description 
 --- | --- | ---
folder\_path | String | **SDK-only parameter** for the `download_folder` method. Specifies the folder path containing the assets to download. The folder path is the part of the public ID before the filename, shown as slashes in the delivery URL (for example, `samples/animals` in the URL path `samples/animals/dog.jpg`). The SDK automatically converts this value to the `prefixes` parameter when calling the API. For direct API calls, use `prefixes` instead. **Note**: If your product environment is using dynamic folder mode, the path portion of your URL may not correspond to the folders in the Media Library.
tags | String | A comma-separated list of tag names. All assets with the specified tags are included in the archive. Up to 20 tags are supported. For example: `animal,dog`**SDKs**: Supports arrays. For example: `['animal', 'dog']`
public\_ids | String | A comma-separated list of public IDs for the specific assets to be included in the archive. Up to 1000 public IDs are supported. **SDKs**: Supports arrays.
prefixes | String | A comma-separated list of prefixes of public IDs (e.g., folders). Setting this parameter to a slash (`/`) is a shortcut for including all assets in the product environment for the given `resource_type` and `type` (up to the max files limit). Up to 20 prefixes are supported.**SDKs**: Supports arrays.
signature | String | **(Required for signed REST API calls)** Used to authenticate the request and based on the parameters you use in the request. When using the Cloudinary SDKs for signed requests, the signature is automatically generated and added to the request. If you manually generate your own signed POST request, you need to manually generate the `signature` parameter and add it to the request together with the `api_key` and `timestamp` parameters. For more details, see [manually generating signatures](authentication_signatures).
### Optional parameters
Parameter | Type| Description
 --- | --- | ---
resource\_type  | String | The type of assets to include. Valid values: `image`, `raw`, `video`, `all`. **Note**: In REST API calls, the `resource_type` is part of the endpoint URL path. In SDK methods, pass it in the options object.**Defaults:**Most SDK methods: `image``download_folder` method: `all`Use the `video` value to request video assets and audio files such as `.mp3`.
type | String | The specific file type of assets to include in the archive (`upload`/`private`/`authenticated`). If tags are specified as a filter then all types are included. **Default**: `upload`.
transformations | String | Allows you to apply one or more transformations to all assets before storing them in the archive. (A single transformation is given as a comma-separated list of transformation parameters, and separated with a slash for chained transformations.) You can specify multiple transformations as a pipe (|) separated list. Each transformation will generate a separate derived asset for each original asset in the archive. For example, specifying `a_20|r_max` will result in two derived assets for each original—one at an angle and one rounded. If this parameter is not specified then the original assets are included in the archive. If you are including multiple asset types in your archive, make sure the transformations you specify are supported for all assets that will be included in the archive. **SDKs**: Supports a hash of transformation parameters (or an array of hashes for chained transformations).**Note**: When using the SDK for a dynamically typed language, the transformation parameters can be specified directly without using the `transformation` parameter.
mode | String | **REST API only** - Determines how to generate and deliver the archive. When using SDKs, the method name you call implicitly sets the mode, so you don't specify this parameter.**REST API values:**`download` - generates and delivers the archive file without storing it in your product environment.`create` - creates and stores it as a raw asset in your Cloudinary product environment (doesn't deliver the archive file itself, but returns a JSON response with the URLs for accessing the archive file).`create_and_download` - creates, stores AND delivers the archive file.**SDK method equivalents:**`download` mode = `download_folder`, `download_zip_url`, or `download_archive_url` methods`create` mode = `create_zip` or `create_archive` methods**Default**: `create`.
target\_format | String | The format for the generated archive: `zip` or `tgz`. **Applicable for:****SDKs**: `create_archive`, `download_archive_url`, and `download_folder` methods only (not applicable for `create_zip` or `download_zip_url`, which always generate ZIP format)**REST API**: any `mode` value**Default**: `zip`
target\_public\_id | String | The name to use for the generated file:  When the `mode` parameter is set to `create` (or when using one of the [create* SDK methods](#archive_sdk_methods)), this parameter defines the public ID to assign to the generated archive. When the `mode` parameter is set to `download` (or when using one of the [download* SDK methods](#archive_sdk_methods)), this parameter defines the filename of the downloaded archive file.If not specified, a random public ID (or download filename) is generated.
target\_asset\_folder | String | The folder where the generated file is placed within the Cloudinary repository. **Applicable for:****SDKs**: `create_zip` and `create_archive` methods only**REST API**: `create` mode only**Not supported**: Product environments using legacy [fixed folder](folder_modes) mode**Default**: If not specified, the generated file will be located in the root of your product environment asset repository, even if the public ID value includes slashes.
flatten\_folders | Boolean | Determines whether to flatten all files to be in the root of the archive file (no sub-folders). Any folder information included in the public ID is stripped and a numeric counter is added to the file name in the case of a name conflict. **Default**: `false`.
flatten\_transformations  | Boolean | If multiple transformations are also applied, determines whether to flatten the folder structure of the derived assets. The transformation details are always stored on the file name. **Default**: `false`.
skip\_transformation\_name | Boolean | Determines whether to strip all transformation details from file names and add a numeric counter to a file name in the case of a name conflict. **Default**: `false`.
allow\_missing | Boolean | Allows generation of the archive if any of the supplied public IDs are not found, instead of returning an error. **Default**: `false`.
expires\_at | Integer | The date (UNIX time in seconds) for the URL expiration (e.g., 1415060076). **Applicable for:****SDKs**: `download_folder`, `download_zip_url`, and `download_archive_url` methods only**REST API**: `download` mode only**Default**: 1 hour from the time that the URL is generated.
use\_original\_filename  | Boolean | Whether to use the original file name of the included assets (if available) instead of the public ID. **Default**: `false`.
async  | Boolean | Whether to perform the archive generation in the background (asynchronously). **Applicable for:****SDKs**: `create_zip` and `create_archive` methods only**REST API**: `create` mode only**Default**: `false`.**Python SDK note**: Because `async` is a reserved keyword in Python, pass it using dictionary unpacking with `**`, for example: `cloudinary.uploader.create_archive(**{"async": True})`
notification\_url | String | An HTTP or HTTPS URL to notify your application (a webhook) when the archive creation process has completed. **Applicable for:****SDKs**: `create_zip` and `create_archive` methods only**REST API**: `create` mode onlyIf not specified, the response is sent to the **Notification URL** (if defined) in the **Webhook Notifications** settings of your Cloudinary Console.
target\_tags | String | A comma-separated list of tag names to assign to the generated archive. For example: `animal,dog`**Applicable for:****SDKs**: `create_zip` and `create_archive` methods only. Supports arrays. For example: `['animal', 'dog']`**REST API**: `create` mode only
keep\_derived  | Boolean | Whether to keep the derived assets used for generating the archive. **Default**: `false.`

|php_2
$result = $cloudinary->uploadApi()
->downloadFolder('MyFavoriteFolder', ['target_public_id' => 'MyFolder']);

|cli
cld utils download_folder "MyFavoriteFolder" target_public_id=MyFolder
```

### Sample response
The following is a sample response based on the `create_zip` example above. 6 image assets with the tag 'lion' were added to the zip file. Because no `target_public_id` was specified in the upload, a random `public_id` was assigned to the zip file.

```json

## multi

Run in Postman
Learn more about running Postman collections

Creates a single animated image (GIF, PNG or WebP), video (MP4 or WebM) or PDF from all image assets with a specified tag or from a set of specified image URLs. 

Each asset becomes a single page or frame in the resulting animated image, video, or PDF, sorted alphabetically by their public ID. 

**Learn more**: [Creating animated images](creating_animated_images) | [Creating PDF files from images](create_pdf_files_from_images)

> **READING**: :no-icon :title=Important note for free accounts

By default, while you can use this method to generate PDF files, Free accounts are blocked from delivering files in PDF format for security reasons. For details, see [Media delivery](image_delivery_options#blocked_delivery_formats_for_security).

### Syntax
`POST /image/multi`

```multi
|ruby 
Cloudinary::Uploader.multi(tag or urls, options = {})
  
|php_2
$cloudinary->uploadApi()->multi($tag or $urls, $options = []);
 
|python
cloudinary.uploader.multi(tag or urls, **options)

|nodejs
cloudinary.v2.uploader.multi(tag or urls, options).then(callback);
  
|java
cloudinary.uploader().multi(String tag or Array urls, Map options);

|csharp
cloudinary.Multi(MultiParams params); 

|swift
cloudinary.createManagementApi().multi(tag or urls, params: params)

|go
resp, err := cld.Upload.Multi(ctx, uploader.MultiParams{})

|cli
cld uploader multi $tag or $urls $options
```

### Required parameters
Parameter | Type| Description
 --- | --- | ---
tag | String | (Required if not using `urls`) The animated GIF or PDF is created from all images with this tag.
signature | String | **(Required for signed REST API calls)** Used to authenticate the request and based on the parameters you use in the request. When using the Cloudinary SDKs for signed requests, the signature is automatically generated and added to the request. If you manually generate your own signed POST request, you need to manually generate the `signature` parameter and add it to the request together with the `api_key` and `timestamp` parameters. For more details, see [manually generating signatures](authentication_signatures).
### Optional parameters
Parameter | Type| Description
 --- | --- | ---
urls | Array | (Required if not using `tag`) The animated GIF or PDF is created from all image URLs in the array.
transformation | String | A transformation to run on all the derived assets before creating the animated image or PDF. This parameter is given as a comma-separated list of transformations, and separated with a slash for chained transformations. **SDKs**: Supports a hash of transformation parameters (or an array of hashes for chained transformations).**Behavior differs for video formats** If the requested output format is a video (`mp4`, `webm`), the transformation behaves differently: - The source images are first combined into a video. - The specified transformation is then applied as a video transformation, not an image transformation. - Some image transformation capabilities are not supported or may not behave as expected in this context.For example, advanced transformations such as: - `g_auto` (automatic gravity) - `c_auto` (automatic cropping) - `dpr_auto`, `q_auto` (automatic DPR or quality) - `f_auto` (automatic format) are designed for individual image optimization and do not apply correctly to video transformations.**Note**: When using the SDK for a dynamically typed language, the transformation parameters can be specified directly without using the `transformation` parameter.
async | Boolean | Tells Cloudinary whether to perform the animated image or PDF generation in the background (asynchronously).**Python SDK note**: Because `async` is a reserved keyword in Python, pass it using dictionary unpacking with `**`, for example: `cloudinary.uploader.multi("logo", **{"async": True})`
format | String | The file format of the result. Valid values: `gif`, `png`, `webp`, `mp4`, `webm` and `pdf`. **Default**: `gif`
delay | Integer | **SDKs only:** The delay in milliseconds between frames. Valid for animated images and video formats. When this is passed with the SDK method, it adds a `dl_<ms>` transformation to the generated URL, so that you can control the speed of the animation.  If using the REST endpoint, you can pass a transformation parameter with the call, for example: `&transformation=dl_500`.
notification\_url | String | An HTTP or HTTPS URL to notify your application (a webhook) when the `multi` process completes. If you don't specify `notification_url`, Cloudinary sends any applicable response to the **Notification URL** (if defined) in the **Webhook Notifications** settings of your Cloudinary Console.**Note:** Cloudinary sends the notification after processing all source assets and generating the combined asset. Processing time varies based on the number and size of assets.
